        <p>Hurricane Harvey makes landfall in Houston, Texas. This storm causes massive flooding, loss of property 
            and some loss of life. Thousands of people are displaced and left without anything. Originally, the game 
            was scheduled to be played at NRG Stadium in Houston. Obviously, plans would change. The area surrounding 
            NRG stadium was completely flooded and the facility would be used for shelter. </p>

        <p>ESPN, the SEC and both teams agreed to moving the game to the Superdome in Baton Rouge, LA. This was 
            important because a game had to be cancelled the previous season when LSU and another team couldn't
            come to an agreement on location.</p>

        <p>Gameday...After much concern over venue, staff and families of those affected, the 2017 season would
            take place. LSU would win the game 27-0, giving up very little offensive production to BYU. This was the
            first game under new Offensive Coordinator, Matt Canada. </p>
